Mapbox Project – Earthquake Data  

# Seeing The Project
Our project is hosted online using Heroku at the following link: https://mapbox-earthquake-data.herokuapp.com/ 

# Using The App
Move around the map using the mouse by clicking and dragging and scroll in the mouse to see fine detail and see actual points of earthquakes. Click on any earthquake point to see its magnitude, if it caused a tsunami or not, and if it was reported by anyone to be a quake they felt (and by how many people if so). 

To filter results, click the “Show Filters” button at the top left of the app. There are three filters: magnitude, tsunami, and felt. For the magnitude filter, enter a magnitude value in the top box, and then in the drop-selector below that entry, choose whether you want that magnitude value to be the minimum or maximum displayed. The other two filters are both drop-down selectors with three options: show all, show only felt quakes/quakes that caused tsunamis, show no felt quakes/quakes that caused tsunamis. 
After you have your desired filters entered, click the “Filter” button. To clear all filters and get the default display of all data, click the “Clear Filters” button. The filters window can be hidden or shown at any time by clicking the same button you originally used to open the filters window at the top left area.
